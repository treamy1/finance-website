    <h2>Importance of Savings</h2>
    <p>
        Saving money is crucial for financial stability and peace of mind, providing a safety net for emergencies and reducing the need for high-interest debt. 
        The benefits of saving include increased financial security, the ability to achieve goals, avoid debt, seize investment opportunities, and enjoy peace of mind. 
        Specifically, saving for an emergency fund ensures you're prepared for unexpected expenses. Setting aside money for specific goals like vacations, buying a home, education, a new car, and retirement helps you plan and achieve these milestones without financial strain. 
        Starting early and saving consistently maximizes your financial growth and stability.

    <h2>50/30/20 Rule</h2>
    <p>
        The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting framework that helps you allocate your income effectively. Under this rule, you should spend 50% of your income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings and debt repayment. This method ensures that you cover essential expenses while still enjoying discretionary spending and prioritizing your financial goals.
    </p>
    <h2>60/30/10 Rule</h2>
    <p>
        The 60/30/10 rule is another useful budgeting guideline that divides your income into three categories: 60% for essentials, 30% for discretionary spending, and 10% for savings and investments. This rule is particularly beneficial for individuals with higher fixed expenses, as it allows a larger portion of income to be allocated towards necessary living costs while still encouraging saving and mindful spending.
