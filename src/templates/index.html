        <h2>Turning Point: The Story of Jamie</h2>
        <p>
            Jamie, a 22-year-old college student, juggled a full-time course load and a part-time job at a local caf√©. Despite the constant hustle, Jamie struggled to make ends meet, often resorting to credit cards to cover unexpected expenses. 
            A wake-up call came when she received several overdrawn account notice, prompting Jamie to seek help. Jamie learned of EYL and decided to take control of her finances.
            Jamie categorized expenses, prioritized high-interest debt repayment, built an emergency fund, and started investing. 
            Over two years, Jamie transformed from financial chaos to stability and growth, eliminating high-interest debt, curbing impulsive spending, and creating a secure financial future.
